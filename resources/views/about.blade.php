        About Pothole Management System
    </x-slot>
    <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
        The Pothole Management System is a community-driven platform designed to streamline the process of reporting and
        resolving road damage issues. Our mission is to improve road safety and maintenance by empowering citizens to
        actively participate in infrastructure monitoring.

        With our user-friendly interface, anyone can report potholes by submitting photos, descriptions, and location
        details. These reports are automatically forwarded to the responsible municipal authorities for swift action.

        Our goal is to reduce road accidents, improve driving conditions, and make our cities smarter and safer. Whether
        you're a concerned citizen or a city administrator, this platform is built to make collaboration simple and
        effective.
